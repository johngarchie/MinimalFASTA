MinimalFASTA version 0.01
=========================

This is the first release of the MinimalFASTA module.  The purpose of this
module is to allow users to easily read and write FASTA sequences to and from
file handles.

This module provides a simple, dependency-free interface for handling FASTA
sequences.  For a feature-rich solution, consider using the Bio::SeqIO and
Bio::Seq modules in the BioPerl package.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
